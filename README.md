# Data Mining 2

Repository for "Data Mining - Advanced Topics and Applications" project exam.

This project consists in analysing and processing audio signals, employing advanced data mining/machine learning algorithms on the FMA dataset. 

This analysis is focused on:
- **Imbalanced learning:** Random Undersampling, CNN, Tomek's Link, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, K-Means SMOTE, ADASYN
- **Anomaly detection:** DBSCAN, KNN, LOF, ABOD, Isolation Forest, Extended Isolation Forest, Autoencoders;
- **Advanced classification methods:** Naive Bayes, Rule-based classifiers, Logistic Regression, SVM, Ensembles (Random-Forest, Bagging, Adaboost) and Neural Netoworks (MLP);
- **Time series analysis:** Motifs & Anomaly detection, Clustering, Shaplet-based classifiers;
- **Sequential Pattern Mining and Advanced Clustering:** X-Means, OPTICS and Transactional Clustering (K-Modes);
- **AI Explaianbility:** LIME explainer;
